This is the *PyLit6* project, designed to create an environment that supports
software development using Dr. Donald Knuth's *Literate Programming* concepts.
However, rather than simply building a tool that recreates Dr. Knuth's ideas, I
have added a few ideas of my own.  These additions to *Literate Programming*
are based on my teaching work, and my goal to produce students who are familiar
with modern tools used in software engineering, and who are ready to produce
code worthy of including in real-world projects.
